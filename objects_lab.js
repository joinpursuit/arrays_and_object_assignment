// # Object Exercises
//
// ## Question 1
//
// Given the cat object below:
//
// ```js
 let cat = {
   genus: 'Felis',
   species: 'Catus'
}
// ```
//
// a. Log the species of `cat`.
console.log(cat.species);

// b. Add a new key 'color' and give it a value.
cat.color = 'black';
console.log(cat)
// c. Write code that logs whether or not `cat` has the property 'texture'.
console.log(cat.property)

// ## Question 2
//
// What will the code below log?  Explain why.
// The code below will log false because while the value is the same, they are in two different objects.
//
// ```js
// let p1 = {
//   name: 'Joe'
// }
//
// let p2 = {
//   name: 'Joe'
// }
//
// console.log(p1 === p2)
// ```
//
// ## Question 3
//
// Given the object variable `spanishNumbers` below:
//
// ```js
let spanishNumbers = {1: "uno", 2: "dos", 3: "tres", 4: "quatro", 5: "cinco"}
// ```
//
// a. Write a code block that takes an object variable and stores the *keys* in an array.  Then log the array.
let spanishNumbersKeys = Object.keys(spanishNumbers);
console.log(spanishNumbersKeys)
// b. Write a code block that takes an object variable and stores the *values* in an array.  Then log the array.
let spanishNumbersValues = Object.values(spanishNumbers);
console.log(spanishNumbersValues)
//
// ## Question 4
//
// Write a code block the logs the number of properties an object has.
let seasons = {
   1: 'Winter',
   2: 'Spring',
   3: 'Summer',
   4: 'Fall'
 }

let seasonKey = Object.keys(seasons).length
console.log(seasonKey)


## Question 5

// Loop through the following object and log all of the directors.
//
// ``` js
let films = [
 {
   name: 'Psycho',
   director: 'Alfred Hitchcock',
   released: 1960
 }, {
   name: 'Citizen Kane',
   director: 'Orson Welles',
   released: 1941
 }, {
   name: 'The Usual Suspects',
   director: 'Bryan Singer',
   released: 1995
 }
]


// //logs 'Alfred Hitchcock', 'Orson Welles', 'Bryan Singer'
// ```

  for(let i = 0; i < films.length; i++){
    console.log(films[i].director);
}
//

//
// // ## Question 6
// //
// // You are given an array of objects. Each object in the array contains exactly 2 keys `“firstName”` and `“lastName”`
// //
// // ```js
let people = [
    {
        "firstName": "Calvin",
        "lastName": "Newton"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Garry",
        "lastName": "Mckenzie"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Leah",
        "lastName": "Rivera"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Sonja",
        "lastName": "Moreno"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Noel",
        "lastName": "Bowen"
    }
]

// ```
for(let i = 0; i < people.length; i++){
 for(let key in people [i]){
   console.log(key, people[i].firstName, people[i].lastName)
//  }
// // console.log(people[i])
// }
// a. Create an array of strings called `firstNames` that contains only the values for `“firstName”` from each object.

// b. Create an array of strings called `fullNames` that contains the values for `“firstName”` and `“lastName”` from the object separated by a space.

//
//
// ## Question 7
//
// Print the second most common letter in the string below:
//
var myString = "We're flooding people with information. We need to feed it through a processor. A human must turn information into intelligence or knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask a new question."
let elem =0;
let count = 0;
for(let i = 0; i < myString.length; i++){
  let tempElem = myString[i];
  let elemCount = 0;
    for(let f = 0; f < myString.length; f++){
      if(myString[f]===tempElem)
      elemCount++;
      if(elemCount > count){
        elem = tempElem;
        count = elemCount;
      }
    }
    console.log(elem + ' is the second most common letter')
}
// // ## Question 8
// //
// // You are given the object `deposits`, which maps a persons name to an array of deposits that have been made to their account.
// //
// // a) Write code to to print the name and total amount deposited of the person who received the most money.
// //
// // b) Create an array called `stolenCents`, iterate over deposits for each person and steal their cents! ... like Office Space or Superman 3. Calculate the decimal part of each value, add it to the `stolenCents` array and round down the value in the original object.
// //
// // c) How much money did you steal?
// //
// // ```js
// let deposits = {
//  "Williams" : [300.65, 270.45, 24.70, 52.00, 99.99],
//  "Cooper" : [200.56, 55.00, 600.78, 305.15, 410.76, 35.00],
//  "Davies" : [400.98, 56.98, 300.00],
//  "Clark" : [555.23, 45.67, 99.95, 80.76, 56.99, 46.50, 265.70],
//  "Johnson" : [12.56, 300.00, 640.50, 255.60, 26.88]
// }
// // ```
// //
// // ## Question 9
// //
// // * Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have the following properties: `name`, `servings`, and `ingredients` (an array).
// // * Create a loop that logs the recipe information, so it looks like:
// //
// // ```javascript
// // name: Mole
// // servings: 2
// // ingredients: cinnamon, cumin, cocoa
// // ```


// ## Question 10
// * Create an array of films, where each film has the following properties: title, director, and a boolean indicating if you started watching it.
// * Create a code block that iterates over the array and logs whether the film was watched or not. Examples:
//
// `You already watched "Wonder Woman" directed by Patty Jenkins`
// `You still need to watch "Wonder Woman" by director Patty Jenkins. `
 let movies = [
{
  name: 'Get out',
  director: 'Jordan Peele',
  watched: true,
},
{
  name: 'Avengers:Endgame',
  director: 'Anthony & Joe Russo',
  watched: false,
},
{
  name: 'Sorry to Bother You',
  director: 'Boots Riley',
  watched: true,
}

 ]

for(let m = 0; m < movies.length; m++){
  console.log(movies)
  if(movies.watched === true){
    console.log('You already watched '+ movies.name + ' directed by ' + movies.director)
  }else{
    console.log('You still need to watch '+ movies.name + ' by director ' + movies.director)

  }
}

// // ## Question 11
// //
// // Given the following exert from the Declaration of Independence, find the most frequent word that is longer than 5 characters.
// //
// // ```js
// // const declarationOfIndependence = `
// // When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the
// // political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the
// // earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle
// // them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
// // which impel them to the separation.
// //
// // We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by
// // their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit
// // of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving
// // their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government
// // becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to
// // institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
// // such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence,
// // indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and
// // transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to
// // suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
// // are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
// // Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
// // to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has
// // been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains
// // them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great
// // Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
// // establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a
// // candid world.
// // `
// // ```
