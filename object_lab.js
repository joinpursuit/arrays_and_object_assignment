//Given the following exert from the Declaration of Independence, find the most frequent word that is longer than 5 characters.

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the ` +
`political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the ` +
`earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle ` +
`them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes ` +
`which impel them to the separation. ` +
`We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by ` +
`their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit ` +
`of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving ` +
`their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government ` +
`becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to ` +
`institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in ` +
`such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, ` +
`indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and ` +
`transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to ` +
`suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they ` +
`are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same ` +
`Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, ` +
`to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has ` +
`been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains ` +
`them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great ` +
`Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the ` +
`establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a ` +
`candid world.`;
